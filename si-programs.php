                    </p>
                    <p class="textnormal">The payment of Workers’ Compensation premiums threatens the livelihood of many
                        businesses throughout the nation. State fund deficits and legal changes have escalated these
                        premiums from $23 billion in 1982 to more than $60 billion in 1990. Unlike regular health-care
                        costs, every employer is required to pick up the tab.</p>
                    <p class="textnormal"><span class="textbold">Changes That Have Impacted Workers’
                            Compensation</span><br>Three major changes occurred in Workers’ Compensation in the 1980’s
                        that transformed a sleepy legislative no-fault benefit program into the volatile cost component
                        it is today. </p>
                    <p class="textnormal">First, programs to control healthcare costs for injuries and illnesses outside
                        the workplace – e.g., deductible, co-payments, HMO utilization review – had the effect of “cost
                        shifting” these medical costs into the Workers’ Compensation arena, where the employer is
                        responsible for every dollar paid.</p>
                    <p class="textnormal">Second, the original no-fault intent of Workers’ Compensation laws has given
                        way to judicial interpretations that have produced a system strangled by litigation. In
                        California, 44% of all Workers’ Compensation cases involving lost time end up in a lawsuit.</p>
                    <p class="textnormal">Third, the nature of workplace injuries and illnesses is shifting
                        dramatically, with an increasing incidence of so-called cumulative trauma injuries and those
                        associated with repetitive motion. The latest is the development of psychological and mental
                        stress claims.</p>
                    <p class="textnormal">Most companies are not set up to react to, let alone manage, the problem.
                        <span class="textbold">Benefit Management Services of Ohio, Inc. provides comprehensive and
                            professional management of your Workers’ Compensation program</span> across the entire
                        spectrum of Workers’ Compensation services from state-funded accounts to group rated programs to
