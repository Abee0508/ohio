                    <p>The OCP is BWC's voluntary rate program for private, state-fund employers currently participating in a group-rating program. The OCP is designed to help employers with minimal claims lessen the financial impact of a single uncharacteristic claim. In order to qualify, the claim must be entering your experience and must have caused your removal from a group-rating program. Eligible employers will receive a 40-percent discount off of their base rate for up to four years while the one significant claim remains in their experience. </p>

                <p>In addition to the 40-percent discount, the OCP provides an opportunity for employers to work closely with their managed care organizations, third party administrators and BWC representatives to gain a better  </p>
                <p>understanding of claims management and work to prevent future claims. A strong relationship with workers' compensation partners and effective claims management can help employers get back into a group-rating program more quickly.</p>
                <p>As a bonus, employers  may also participate in BWC's Drug-Free Workplace Program or Drug-Free EZ and stack the drug-free premium discount on top of the OCP base rate discount. </p>
                <p>To be eligible for the OCP, a participant must:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>To maintain eligibility in the OCP, employers must:</p>
                <ul>
