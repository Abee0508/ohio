We’ve made it easy to meet others who share your passion for agriculture and stay connected all year long, with signature events like the Winter Leadership Experience and Washington, D.C. Leadership Experience, and programs like AgriPOWER and Collegiate Farm Bureaus. For students pursuing education in ag-related fields, there are a variety of scholarships available through our foundation and county Farm Bureaus. American Farm Bureau also offers an annual Leadership Conference.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mt-3">Check here to see if there is a YAP group near you. Find us on Facebook and sign up for our Growing our Generation e-newsletter for insights and ideas directly from young farmers.</p>
