             <span>PDP + and DFWP Stacking</span>
              <p>The current stacking rule allows employers to stack the discounts for PDP+ and DFWP/DF-EZ in program years beginning 1/1/02, 7/1/02 or 1/1/03. If the premium discounts are stacked in any of these three periods, the stacked discounts will continue to be applied if employers participating in both programs are successfully meeting the requirements.</p>
              <p>Due to the fact that the PDP+ maximum duration is three years and the DFWP/DF-EZ maximum duration is five years, the longest an employer can participate in both programs simultaneously is three years. Therefore, an employer enrolled in both programs at the same time can only receive the stacked discounts for a maximum of three years.</p>
              <p>The PDP+ discount will be applied first since the applicable rule does not allow the discount to reduce the EM below .15. After the PDP+ discount is applied, the DFWP/DF-EZ discount will then be calculated.</p>
