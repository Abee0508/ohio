                    <p>The Ohio Growth Association was formed on July 17, 1998 initially named the Ohio Chamber
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">The Ohio Chamber Alliance was developed to provide products and services to chambers
                        of commerce that did not have the personnel needed to structure programs on behalf of their
                        local chambers.  Also recognizing the time constraints of the individual chambers and
                        ever-changing personnel a service was needed to oversee the structuring of such programs as a
                        healthcare plan to offer to chamber members. At the time of the organizational development of
                        OCA many chambers of commercial and other local trade groups recognized the value of working
                        together to develop a large structure for strength in marketing.</p>
